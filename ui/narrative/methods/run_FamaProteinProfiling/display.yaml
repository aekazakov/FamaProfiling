        ui-name : |
            Genomes
        short-hint : |
            Select one or several genomes
        long-hint : |
            Select one or several genome objects

        ui-name : |
            Reference Dataset
        short-hint : |
            Choose a reference dataset for profiling from the list
        long-hint : |
            For functional profiling of nitrogen cycle, choose nitrogen cycle proteins. For taxonomic profiling, choose either unversal marker proteins or ribosomal protein L6 dataset.
    output_feature_set_name:
        ui-name : |
            Output Feature Set name
        short-hint : |
            Enter name for filtered feature set
        long-hint : |
            The app will create a feature set containing a list of functional genes. Choose a name for the feature set.
    output_annotation_name:
        ui-name : |
            Annotation prefix
        short-hint : |
            Prefix for annotation names, to be added to genome names
        long-hint : |
            The app will create one or several annotation objects, one for each input genome, with names consisting of a prefix added to the genome name. Enter the prefix for names of functional annotations objects.

    <p>This app is based on Fama computational tool for functional profiling of microbiomes and taxonomic profiling of functional genes (https://github.com/novichkov-lab/fama). Initially created for functional profiling of microbial communities, Fama can be used for functional genes of interest in annotated genome assemblies as well.</p>

    <p>Fama Protein Profiling runs similarity search for all predicted proteins in a genome using fast aligner DIAMOND and customized databases of reference proteins. After the similarity search, all hits found by DIAMOND are filtered by AAI (amino acid identity %) with family-specific thresholds. Top hits that pass the filter are counted for functional and taxonomic assignment.</p> 
    
    <p>Currently, three reference datasets are available in Fama Profiling:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>nitrogen cycle enzymes dataset for functional and taxonomic profiling of nitrate/nitrite/ammonia metabolic genes</li>
        <li>30 families of universal single-copy marker proteins from complete bacterial and archaeal genomes for taxonomic profiling and check for contamination</li>
        <li>Ribosomal protein L6 sequences from genomes of cultivated bacteria and metagenome-assembled genomes for fast taxonomic profiling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fama Profiling output includes report in HTML format, tables with results in Excel format and interactive plot.</p>
