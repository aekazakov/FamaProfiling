description : |
    <p>Functional profile captures genetic potential of microbial community for biological processes of interest, just like taxonomic profile captures microbial diversity. This app is based on the Fama computational tool for functional profiling of microbiomes and taxonomic profiling of functional genes.</p>
    
    <p>Fama examines genetic potential of a microbial community and taxonomic composition of functional genes by direct mapping of individual sequence reads to a curated reference set of proteins. This tool has been developed for research projects focused on a specific metabolic process in microbial communities containing uncultured and phylogenetically distinct microbes with little similarity to known genomes. For such organisms, amino acid sequence comparisons have an advantage over nucleotide sequence comparison for characterization of genes.</p>
    
    <p>Fama runs a similarity search for translated read sequences using fast aligner DIAMOND and customized databases of reference proteins. After the similarity search, all hits found by DIAMOND are filtered by AAI (amino acid identity %) with family-specific thresholds. Top hits that pass the filter are counted for functional and taxonomic assignment.</p> 
    
    <p>For comparison between functions and between samples, raw read counts are normalized by library size, target gene size and predicted average genome size in the sample. For normalization by average genome size, Fama employs MicrobeCensus tool.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, three reference datasets are available in Fama Profiling:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>nitrogen cycle enzymes dataset for functional and taxonomic profiling of nitrate/nitrite/ammonia metabolic genes</li>
        <li>30 families of universal single-copy marker proteins from complete bacterial and archaeal genomes for taxonomic profiling</li>
        <li>ribosomal protein L6 sequences from genomes of cultivated bacteria and metagenome-assembled genomes for fast taxonomic profiling of uncultured organisms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For comparison between functions and between samples, raw read counts are normalized by library size, target gene size and predicted average genome size in the sample. For normalization by average genome size, Fama employs MicrobeCensus tool.</p>

    <p>Fama Profiling output includes report in HTML format, tables with results in Excel format and interactive plot.</p>
